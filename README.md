Quantum tunneling and hydrogen production modeling using MAPbI₃/h-BN/MoS₂ heterostructure
# MAPbI3/h-BN/MoS2 Tunneling and Hydrogen Production Modeling

This repository contains a Python-based theoretical model for calculating:

- Quantum tunneling probability through monolayer h-BN barrier
- Photocurrent generation in MAPbI₃/h-BN/MoS₂ heterostructure
- Hydrogen production rate under visible light (550 nm)
- External quantum efficiency (EQE), power efficiency, and current density
- Parametric analysis for barrier thickness
  
Scientific Background

The system simulates photo-generated electron tunneling from MAPbI₃, through h-BN, to MoS₂, estimating viable hydrogen production from water splitting based on photon flux and tunneling probability.
